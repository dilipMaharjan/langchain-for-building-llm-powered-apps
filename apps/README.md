---

### 🔹 2. **Chains**  
Chains are the building blocks of LangChain applications. They define the sequence of operations, combining multiple LLM calls and external processes into **multi-step workflows**.  

**Example:**  
- Retrieve data from a document → Summarize it → Generate a response → Display output.  

Chains make it easy to orchestrate complex operations without writing repetitive boilerplate code.  

---

### 🔹 3. **Memory**  
Memory adds **context retention** to applications. This allows for more natural and meaningful interactions, where the LLM remembers previous messages or actions.  

**Use Case:**  
- In a chatbot, memory ensures the assistant remembers the user’s previous queries and preferences, making the conversation more coherent.  

---

### 🔹 4. **Agents**  
Agents use **decision-making logic** to determine which actions to take based on the input they receive. They can interact with external APIs, search the web, or perform calculations.  

**Example:**  
- A travel assistant agent can automatically book flights, hotels, and fetch real-time weather updates.  

---

### 🔹 5. **Tools**  
Tools are external integrations that LangChain agents can use to **enhance functionality**. This can include:  
- **Search engines** for real-time information retrieval.  
- **Databases and APIs** for data access.  
- **Custom scripts** to perform specific operations.  

---

### 🔹 6. **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**  
LCEL is LangChain’s custom language for **defining chains and workflows** in a flexible and expressive manner. It allows you to describe complex chains in a simplified format, making your code more readable and maintainable.  

---

✅ With this modular ecosystem, LangChain enables you to build **robust, scalable, and intelligent LLM-powered applications** with ease.

## Model Input/Output  
**Input** refers to the data provided to the system, such as user queries, prompts, structured data, or documents.

**Output** is the response returned by the language model, which can be in the form of text, structured data, or action steps.

LangChain applications typically follow a flow where input is passed through prompts and language models, processed, and returned as output.

In LangChain, Chains are sequences of components where the output of one step can serve as the input for the next. Each chain component defines:
- `input_keys`: required input data
- `output_keys`: expected output data

**Prompt Template** is a reusable format that defines how input variables are inserted into a prompt string. It ensures structured and consistent prompt creation for the language model.

**Chat Prompt Template** is used specifically for chat-based models. It organizes input into a sequence of messages (e.g., system, user, assistant roles) and supports dynamic construction of conversational prompts.

To build effective applications, it’s important to clearly define and manage the input and output at each step of the chain or workflow.

## Chatbot Memory  

## 🧠 What is Chat Memory?

Chat memory stores previous inputs and outputs from the conversation. This context allows the model to generate more relevant responses, simulate memory, and behave more naturally in extended dialogues.

---

## 📜 What is Chat History?

**Chat history** refers to the structured log of past interactions between a human and an AI. In LangChain, memory modules use this history to create context for the current prompt.

Chat history can be stored as:
- A **list of messages** (buffer memory)
- A **moving window** (limited number of messages)
- A **token-limited buffer** (limited by token count)
- A **summary string** (summary of conversation)

These formats affect how much of the conversation is remembered and how it's represented.

---

## 🧩 Chat Memory Types and Definitions

### 1. `ConversationBufferMemory`
> **Definition:** Stores the entire chat history as a buffer of messages.

- Keeps full conversation.
- Simple and effective for short sessions.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
```

---

### 2. `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`
> **Definition:** Stores only the most recent `k` interactions.

- Trims older messages.
- Helps control memory size and token usage.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=3)
```

---

### 3. `ConversationTokenBufferMemory`
> **Definition:** Stores memory based on the number of tokens, not message count.

- Trims history based on token count.
- Great for managing LLM token limits.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationTokenBufferMemory

memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=1000)
```

---

### 4. `ConversationSummaryMemory`
> **Definition:** Generates a summary of the conversation using an LLM to reduce context length.

- Compresses long chats into a short summary.
- Ideal for long-running agents.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory

memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)
```

---

## 🛠️ Viewing and Resetting Chat History

- **View history contents:**

```python
print(memory.buffer)
```

- **Clear/reset history:**

```python
memory.clear()
```

## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)  
🔍 Definition  
LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a declarative and composable syntax within LangChain for building chains of operations. It enables developers to connect components such as prompts, language models, tools, and output parsers in a clear and structured way using intuitive expressions. Each component behaves like a callable unit, known as a "runnable," that can be linked together to form pipelines.

❓ Why Use LCEL  
LCEL simplifies the process of designing and executing multi-step language model workflows. It replaces verbose, class-based chaining with a streamlined syntax that is easier to read and maintain. LCEL encourages modular programming, supports advanced features like streaming and batching, and enables rapid prototyping of complex chains.

✅ Benefits  
- Declarative syntax that focuses on what to do, not how to do it  
- Modular design that makes components easy to reuse  
- Improved readability for both simple and complex workflows  
- Native support for streaming and batching operations  
- Seamless integration with LangChain tools and features  

🔗 Chain  
A chain in LCEL is a sequence of runnable components connected in a pipeline. Each component processes input and passes the result to the next. Chains allow for clear, logical construction of workflows involving prompts, models, and output handlers.

🧪 Batch  
Batching in LCEL allows multiple inputs to be processed at once through the same chain. It is ideal for bulk tasks like running the same prompt across many items, making it efficient for scaling up inference or evaluations.

🌀 Stream  
Streaming in LCEL allows outputs from language models to be received incrementally as they are generated. This is useful for real-time applications where immediate feedback is important, such as chatbots or live data processing.

🧱 Runnables

LangChain Runnables are the foundational building blocks for constructing modular, composable, and testable pipelines in language model applications. This section covers their definition, composition, parallelism, and visualization.

🔹 What Are Runnables?
Runnables are the core abstraction in LangChain representing any unit of computation that takes input and produces output. They enable a consistent and composable interface for building LLM-based pipelines.

🔹 Chaining Runnables
Runnables can be chained to form a sequence where the output of one becomes the input of the next. This allows modular and readable pipeline construction.

🔹 Piping with `.pipe()`
`.pipe()` is a method for chaining Runnables explicitly. It is functionally equivalent to using the `|` operator but may be clearer in complex setups.

🔹 Branching with `RunnableParallel`
`RunnableParallel` enables multiple Runnables to be executed in parallel on different branches of input. Each branch can process the input differently and return a combined result.

🔹 Visualizing Chains with `grandalf`
Chains of Runnables can be visualized as graphs using the `grandalf` library. This is useful for debugging, documentation, and understanding pipeline structure.

✅ Summary
- **Runnables** are composable units of work.
- Use chaining and piping to build modular workflows.
- Apply `.map()` for parallel inputs and `RunnableParallel` for branching logic.
- Visualize chains using `grandalf` to gain clarity on structure and flow.
