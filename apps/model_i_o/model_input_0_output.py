Prerequisites:
virtual environment created

pip install langchain
pip install -U langchain-ollama

'''


'''
creating instance of ChatOpenAI,model and temperature selection
temperature defines randomness of response
    0.0 - 2.0   Range
    0.0	        Deterministic (least random)
    ~0.3-0.7	Balanced (creative but relevant)
    1.0	        Very creative, more diverse
    > 1.0	    Often chaotic, less coherent
model_name defines model
